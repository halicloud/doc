letter-2021-1

I'm glad to hear you have just graduated from University and plan to find a job in China. I am writing this email to offer several practical suggestions for you.

To begin with, since you are a native English speaker and major in teaching English as a second language. I suggest that you apply for a position teaching English here. In addition, many primary schools in remote areas are in need of qualified English teachers.

Well, I hope to give the above proposal to you food for thought.  I looking forward to your reply.
